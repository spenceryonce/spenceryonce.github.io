## **Overview**

SyAI offers various AI models for generating text completions, including ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo, ChatGPT 4, Davinci 3, and Ada, as well as both code Davinci models. We are continuously working to improve and expand our offerings and plan to add more image generators and HuggingChat in the future.

## **Getting Started**

### **Choose AI Model**

To get started, first, choose the AI model you want to use from the dropdown menu. There are several options available, ranging from faster but less accurate models to slower but more accurate models, and even AI models specifically designed for code completion.

### **Choose AI Behavior**

Next, choose the AI's acting behavior from the dropdown menu. The AI can act as different characters, like an artist or a businessman, to provide more tailored responses. Some options may be disabled due to the limitations of the AI models.

## **Entering a Prompt**

Once you've selected an AI model and behavior, enter your prompt in the text area. A prompt is a message or question that you want the AI to respond to. Be as descriptive as possible to help the AI understand your request and provide a relevant response.

## **Generating AI Response**

After entering your prompt, click the "Generate" button to get the AI's response. It may take a few seconds for the AI to process your request and generate a response.

## **Clearing Chat**

If you want to clear the chat and start over, click the "Clear Chat" button. This will remove all previous prompts and responses.

## **Sharing Chat**

The sharing chat feature is currently under development. In the future, it will allow you to share your chat sessions with others via a unique link.

## **Switching Theme**

You can switch the theme of the SyAI interface by clicking the "Swap Theme" button. This will toggle between the light and dark theme, allowing you to choose the one that best suits your preference.

## **Troubleshooting**

If you encounter any issues or receive unexpected responses from the AI, try the following:

1. Make sure your prompt is clear and specific.
2. Choose a different AI model or behavior.
3. Refresh the page and try again.

If the issue persists, please refer to the support section below.
